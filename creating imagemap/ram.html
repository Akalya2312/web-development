 <h2>Random Access Memory (RAM) </h2>
 <img src="ram.jpg" alt="RAM" width="400">
 <p>RAM is a temporary storage device that holds active data and programs for quick
access.</p>
 <p>It plays a crucial role in system performance by allowing faster data retrieval than storage
drives.</p>
 <p>The more RAM a system has, the better it can handle multitasking and large
applications.</p>
 <p>Unlike a hard drive, RAM is volatile, meaning it loses all data when the power is turned
off.</p>
