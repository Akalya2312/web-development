 <p><strong>Pack Smart:</strong> Carry only what you need, including weather-appropriate
clothing, essential documents, and travel-size toiletries. A light backpack makes traveling
easier.</p>
 <p><strong>Plan Your Budget:</strong> Set a spending limit for accommodation, food, and
activities. Book flights and hotels in advance to get the best deals.</p>
 <p><strong>Stay Safe:</strong> Keep digital and physical copies of important documents
like passports and visas. Be aware of local customs and emergency contacts.</p>
 <p><strong>Embrace Local Culture:</strong> Try traditional foods, learn basic phrases in
the local language, and respect cultural practices for a more immersive experience.</p>
